# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
Tic-Tac-Toe-Game is a very simple game is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O.
The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game, with a forced draw
assuming best play from both players.It is also called noughts and crosses in 'Commonwealth English, and Xs and Os in Irish English.

#Rules of the Game
->The game is to be played between two people (in this program between player1 and player2).
->One of the player chooses ‘O’ and the other ‘X’ to mark their respective cells.
->The game starts with one of the players and the game ends when one of the players has one whole row/ column/ diagonal filled with his/her respective character
(‘O’ or ‘X’).
->If no one wins, then the game is said to be draw.
#Implementation
In this program ,I have coded mainly 2 function to perform the task required for this to execute.
Two functions are: int checkwin();
                   void board();
